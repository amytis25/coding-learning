<h1>
  Welcome to my Portfolio website!

</h1>
<h2>
  I developed this website to showcase a compilation of my personal 
  and professional projects. Building the website itself was a 
  project undertaken not just to enhance my understanding of web development but 
  also to exhibit my proficiency in this domain. Hope This project helps you
  get to know me a little better!
